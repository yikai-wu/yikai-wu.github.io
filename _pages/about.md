My name is Yikai Wu <a href="https://www.name-coach.com/yikai-wu" target="_blank" title="NameCoach"><i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i></a> (Prounanciation:ee-keye uu, Chinese: 吴溢恺, Japanese: ウー・イーカイ). I am an first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Princeton University.

My current research interests are optimization theory and algorithms. I am currently working with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/" target="_blank">Sanjeev Arora</a> on analyzing implicit bias in optimization algorithms. I am also broadly interested in theoretical computer science.

I have received my Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from <a href="https://www.duke.edu" target="_blank">Duke University</a>. At Duke, I have worked with Prof. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~rongge/" target="_blank">Rong Ge</a> on Hessian in optimization algorithms, Prof. <a href="https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ashwin/" target="_blank">Ashwin Machanavajjhala</a> on differentially private algorithms.

I have also worked with Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/vishnoi/Home.html" target="_blank">Nisheeth Vishnoi</a> at Yale University on optimization on manifolds.

**Research interests:** algorithms, optimization
